2. Engage Edit > Macros > Start Macro Recording
3. Then select a folder in the project tree that you would like to upload and hit right click > Deployment > Upload to... (or Ctrl+Shift+Alt+X)
4. When a list of servers will appear, do not click the server with mouse but press the number key instead
5. Repeat "Upload to..." action with different numbers.
6. When you will upload the folder to all the servers, stop the macro recording via Edit > Macros > Stop Macro Recording
7. When asked, provide a name for a macro
8. Check that macro consists of PublishGroup.UploadTo and Typing actions in Edit > Macros > Edit Macros
9. Now you can assign the macro with a shortcut in File | Settings | Keymap > Macros

Note that servers list in "Upload to..." is sorted alphabetically so you should remember about this when adding or removing the servers.
